# ProDualNet:Dual-Target Protein Sequence Design Method Based on Protein Language Model with ProDualNet

Waiting for the preprint 

Install Python>=3.0, PyTorch, Numpy.

The main folder includes the execution code and test cases for ProdualNet. You can use it to design dual-target proteins, such as GLP-1/GCGR dual agonists, or proteins designed to bind with different receptors, causing conformational changes. 

The mutation_task folder is for a zero-shot protein function prediction task, including thermal stability and DDG.

The baseline folder on my GitHub contains a modified multi-state design model based on ProteinMPNN, supporting multiple conformations.
