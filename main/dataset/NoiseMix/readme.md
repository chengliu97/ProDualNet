We provide the processed dual-target experimental data and test datasets from the NoiseMix stage. 
The links are as follows:

Wait for preprint

- x_train_multi.pt: Training data
- x_test_multi.pt: Test data
- x_test_sim_rmsd.pt / x_train_sim_rmsd.pt: Similarity between the two receptors, and the Ca-RMSD when the designed protein binds to both receptors
- dict_x_test_30_159.pt, dict_x_test_sim_50_rmsd_2.pt, lst_diff_inter_38_data.pt: Test sets for three different conditions

Additionally, different subsets of the test set can be re-extracted based on various conditions using the function dual_target_dataset.ipynb from the test set. For example, subsets can be based on sequence similarity between two receptors and the conformational changes (Ca-RMSD) observed when the designed protein binds to different receptors.
