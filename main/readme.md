- proteinmpnn_single_eval.ipynb and proteinmpnn_mean_eval.ipynb are the execution scripts for the comparison methods. 
- proteinmpnn_mean_eval.ipynb can load different ProteinMPNN weights, including the ones fine-tuned on our dual-target data using NoiseMix.
- produalnet_eval_unconditional.ipynb is the recovery calculation script, which does not rely on an autoregressive approach.
- produalnet_design_fasta_eval.ipynb is the evaluation script based on an autoregressive approach.
- produalnet_dual_agonist_case.ipynb is a dual-agonist design script for GLP-1/GCGR, where you can specify conserved sites. The
- specific weights can be downloaded as follows:
